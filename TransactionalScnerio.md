# In a movie ticket booking system, transactional scenarios can involve multiple operations that need to be performed atomically, meaning that either all of the operations are completed successfully, or none of them are completed at all. This is important to ensure the consistency and integrity of the system's data.

## Here are some examples of transactional scenarios that might be relevant to a movie ticket booking system:

Booking a ticket: This scenario involves multiple operations, such as retrieving movie and theater details, calculating the ticket price, processing payment, and creating the ticket. If any of these operations fail, the ticket should not be booked and the system should roll back any changes that have been made.

Cancelling a ticket: This scenario involves deleting a ticket from the system and possibly refunding the payment. Both of these operations need to be performed atomically to avoid inconsistencies.

Updating showtimes: This scenario might involve changing the start time or end time of a showtime, or adding or deleting seats. These operations need to be performed atomically to ensure that the showtime and seat availability are consistent.

## Design decisions for handling transactional scenarios in a movie ticket booking system might include the following:

Using a database that supports transactions: A database that supports transactions allows multiple operations to be executed as a single unit of work, either all completing successfully or all rolling back if any of the operations fail.

Using a transactional middleware: A transactional middleware is a software layer that sits between the application and the database, and can be used to manage transactions across multiple operations and resources.

Implementing the retry pattern: In some cases, transactional scenarios might fail due to temporary issues such as network outages or resource contention. The retry pattern involves retrying the operation a set number of times before giving up, in the hope that the issue will resolve itself.

Implementing the circuit breaker pattern: The circuit breaker pattern involves wrapping a transactional scenario in a circuit breaker that monitors the success or failure of the operation. If the operation fails repeatedly, the circuit breaker will open, preventing further attempts until a set period of time has passed. This can help to prevent the system from becoming overloaded or unavailable due to failed transactions.
