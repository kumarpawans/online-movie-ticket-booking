### CAP theorem is key to understanding how to design strong distributed systems
The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only provide two of three properties simultaneously: 
consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. The theorem formalizes the tradeoff between consistency and availability when there’s a partition.

A distributed system is a collection of computers that work together to form a single computer for end users. All of the distributed machines have one shared state and operate concurrently. With distributed systems, users must be able to communicate with any of the distributed machines without knowing it’s only one machine. The distributed system network stores its data on more than just a single node, using multiple physical or virtual machines at the same time.
